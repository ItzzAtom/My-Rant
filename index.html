                If you arrived here from the link in MC: This story is inspired by a post I found on Reddit that struck a chord with my own experiences. I’ve added a personal touch at the end, but most of this belongs to the original writer.

                Almost every day, a simple misunderstanding spirals into a full-blown screaming match at home. It usually starts from something trivial—maybe I didn't fold the laundry "properly," misunderstood a vague instruction, or left a single hair in the bathroom sink. These arguments can last an hour or more, and I often end up losing my voice from yelling back after trying to hold out for the first 15 minutes.
            </p>

                I don’t remember starting any of these fights. When I try to explain that she was the one who began yelling, she turns it around and blames me for making the original "mistake." It's as if my errors justify her endless tirades, crushing my already fragile mental health. In her mind, if I didn’t want to be yelled at, I shouldn’t have made a mistake at all. Whenever I try to reason with her, she threatens to take away my freedoms and privileges until I’m forced to emotionally beg just to get a bit of peace or a chance to see the friends who keep me grounded.

                There are never any apologies afterward. Between fights, she’ll say she loves me and wants what’s best for me, but by now I’ve learned to tune out those empty words. It’s just more background noise in a cycle that repeats endlessly—sometimes within hours, sometimes the next morning.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can't help but wonder what fuels this never-ending rage. Is it depression? Unfulfillment? Maybe she resents her own life and takes it out on me because I’m an easy target. I’m powerless—I can’t win an argument, and if I try, my freedom gets threatened. If I call her out on her power trips, she mocks me, turning my words into a joke while still screaming.
            </p>

                Does this count as abuse? I’ve never been physically harmed, but the emotional toll is real. Do any of your parents act this way—endlessly cycling through these unbearable arguments? If so, how do you cope? I could really use some advice.

                Now my dad is also doing this except he doesn't hit or something he just yells at me for the smallest things. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, trying to avoid the next explosion. It's exhausting and I just want it to stop.
